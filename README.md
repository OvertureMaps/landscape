# Overture Maps Landscape

![Overture Maps Landscape Logo](https://landscape.overturemaps.org/images/omf.png)

This landscape is intended as a map to explore the Overture Maps Ecosystem, and also shows the member companies of the Overture Maps Foundation. It is modeled after the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) [landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io) and based on the same open-source code.

This repository contains the data files and images required to generate the [Overture Maps Landscape](https://landscape.overturemaps.org). The software that generates it can be found at the [cncf/landscape2](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2) repository. Please see its [README file](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2#landscape2) for more information about how it works.

## New Entries and Corrections

All the data in this repository is built nightly using the [LFX Landscape Tools](https://github.com/jmertic/lfx-landscape-tools). Any changes made directly in the data files in this repository will be overwritten.

- For member entries, you can make these changes in [LFX Organization Dashboard](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/organization-dashboard/organization-profile).

## Local Build and Install

You can build the landscape locally on your machine using the [landscape2](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2) tool. Once [installed](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), you can use the commands below to build the landscape and serve it locally.
