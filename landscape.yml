InterObject is based in Ramat Gan, Israel and specializes in embedded software, mobile and streaming media products.[10] In 2010, GlobalLogic received funding from Goldman Sachs.[4]

              In 2011, GlobalLogic opened an office in Santiago, Chile to expand its operations in South America.[11] The company acquired Rofous Software, a content engineering firm headquartered in Hyderabad, India.[12] In 2012 the company appointed Mr. Shashank Samant as it's CEO.
