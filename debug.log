Wikpedia: 

GlobalLogic was initially founded as 'Induslogic' in 2000, with headquarters in Vienna, Virginia, a delivery center in Noida, India, and funding from New Atlantic Ventures. In 2002 they appointed Mr. Peter Harrison as CEO. Mr. Harrison was instrumental in setting the company on a new path to become a provider of Outsourced Product Engineering services. In 2004 Vasudev Bhandarkar joined Globallogic as its first Independent Board Member.

GlobalLogic received Series B Venture round funding of $12.5M from Westbridge Capital and New Enterprise Associates in 2006[5] and acquired Lambent Technologies, a offshore software R&D services firm based in Nagpur, India led by Mr. Shashikant Chaudhary who is currently Managing Director of Globallogic's India operations. Lambent Technologies eventually became Globallogic's Center of Excellence for Mobile Products. Induslogic became GlobalLogic after its merger with Bonus Technology, an offshore software R&D services firm based in New Jersey with operations out of Kyiv, Ukraine and specializing in mobile and telecommunication technologies.[3] In 2007, GlobalLogic opened delivery centers in Beijing.[6] In 2007, Globallogic appointed Mr. Shashank Samant as President of the company.

In 2008, GlobalLogic opened in London, England and named Mike Daniels as Chairman of the Board.[7] The company received $29.5M in Series C venture round funding from Sequoia Capital, New Atlantic Ventures and New Enterprise Associates.[8] In 2009, GlobalLogic partnered with LumenData, a product development and services firm focused on enterprise data management, to open a delivery center in Bangalore.[9] The company also acquired two offshore software R&D services firms: InterObject and Cubika. InterObject is based in Ramat Gan, Israel and specializes in embedded software, mobile and streaming media products.[10] In 2010, GlobalLogic received funding from Goldman Sachs.[4]

In 2011, GlobalLogic opened an office in Santiago, Chile to expand its operations in South America.[11] The company acquired Rofous Software, a content engineering firm headquartered in Hyderabad, India.[12] In 2012 the company appointed Mr. Shashank Samant as it's CEO. The company also acquired Method Incorporated, a brand experience agency with offices in San Francisco, New York City and London.[13]'
